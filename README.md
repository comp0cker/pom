## Resistance Calculation

Calculation formula pulled from [this thread](http://pokegym.net/community/index.php?threads/tournament-resistance-calculation.29506/).

Each player is stored as follows:

```javascript
player = {
    name: 'Jared',
    wins: 9,
    ties: 0,
    losses: 0
}
```
